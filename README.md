This example shows how to perform training and inference with SageMaker's built-in Recomendation Machine algorithm.

The method we will use is a Factorization Machine regression. Factorization Machine is a general-purpose supervised learning algorithm that you can use for classification and regression tasks. It is an extension of a linear model that is designed to parsimoniously capture interactions between features in high-dimensional sparse data sets. For example, in a click prediction system, the Factorization Machine model can capture observed click rate patterns. Factoring machines are a good choice for tasks related to high-dimensional sparse data sets, such as click prediction and item recommendation.

The Amazon SageMaker Factorization Machine algorithm provides a robust and highly scalable implementation of this algorithm, which has become extremely popular in ad click prediction and recommendation systems.

## Data
---

[F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1â€“19:19.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2827872)

MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.
 
This data set consists of:
* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
* Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site (movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic information were removed from this data set. Detailed descriptions of the data file can be found at [link](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k-README.txt).


Variables in the dataset [ua.base](./ml-100k/ua.base) and [ua.test](./ml-100k/ua.test): 
* **userId** = unique identifier of the user.
* **movieId** = unique identifier of the movie.
* **rating** = User rating of the movie (1-5).
* **timestamp** = date variable.
